  *
  * Temporary directory
  *   A temporary directory (cache) that the system can clear at any time. On iOS, this corresponds to the NSCachesDirectory.
  *   On Android, this is the value that getCacheDir() returns.
  *
  * Documents directory
  *   A directory for the app to store files that only it can access. The system clears the directory only when the app is deleted.
  *    On iOS, this corresponds to the NSDocumentDirectory. On Android, this is the AppData directory.

  This example stores information in the documents directory. You can find the path to the documents directory as follows:
